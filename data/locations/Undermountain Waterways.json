You spin your body about in a tight circle, bringing your tail to bare on it with a vicious smash! Ouch! The rock didn't give way, though it did look like it got pushed a bit further between the others.\n\nOkay, a bit more force is called for. You swim back upstream a few dragon-lengths before darting forward, letting the current aid you. With a quick spin at the last moment, you bring all your strength into a vicious smash! That hurt much less, as the stone cracked in two, half of it flying off down the river! The second half follows it quickly, and without a proper wedge the others break off and go tumbling downstream and out of sight as well! A trio of rocks remain, themselves dug tightly into the riverbed, but your passage is quite clear now.\n\nBut where will this dark tunnel lead you?"
